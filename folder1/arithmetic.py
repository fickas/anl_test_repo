  Return the subtraction of two numbers::

  .. math:: `\mathtt{x} - \mathtt{y}'

  Parameters
  ----------
  x: int, real, complex
     first operand
  y: int, real, complex
     second operand
  round: positive int, optional
     If None, does no rounding. Else rounds the result to places specified, e.g., 2.

  Returns
  -------
  z: int, real, complex
      the result of subtraction

  Raises
  ------
  ValueError:
      when 'x' or 'y' is not a number

  See Also
  --------
  Of course, subtraction is built-in to Python as minus sign.

  Notes
  -----
  The algorithm is a straightforward implementation of
  subtraction.
